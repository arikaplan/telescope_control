note that the precision on these scans is not perfect, figure 
out what precision is required, i think its coming from rounding 
errors and conversion between cts and degrees.


decide if speed should be set or variable

find absolute position of encoder, right now there is no reference
point


code to keep telescope from pointing below horizon may need higher limit than 0

it might be possible/better to combine the forward and backward passes into one block of code, use -1**i and a list for min/max az then do list[i % 2] or something like that (scan.py: linearScan() & horizontalScan())

for azscan think about the best way to do input parameters for rotation, i.e. distance based on distance, time, or rotations, have each option as a button?

cant do more than one rotation in azscan? AM times out after 5 seconds 

changing the speed of az motor creates an error...except now it doesnt

add elevation logic to not let azscan go below horizon, at some point

you could define some function that sets the absolute zero at some random position, then always return to that position at the end of each session, that way when it turns on the next time the zero will always be the same, whereas now zero is wherever it happens to be positioned when it turns on

figure out if there is a better way to convert az el coordinates outputted by ephem into degrees(planets.py)

put in logic that allows for different scan times at each elevation(scan.py: azScan())

if I stick with time method, put in logic to convert time to distance

****eventually you should figure out how to connect to the controller in some macro program, and not have to do it in each individual script, this will probably come naturally with the interface.
also should get around setting the motion controls in each script******

moveto speed and scan speed should probably be different(scan.py vs moveto.py)

forward/backward pass # comments are incorrect, jumps form 1 to 3, figure out the right way to do this(scan.py: linearScan() & horizontalScan())

putting moveto.location in azScan in different locations in script effects functionality, might have to do with setting acceleration and deceleration before vs after moveto


Think about how best to display ouput, and what output we want to display (gui related)


gui.py cant run on its own as is until I run one of the other programs, I imagine this has something to do with connecting to the machine. Except I just turned on the machine and it didnt have a problem this time...

WTF is different between gui_basic and gui_tabs?!?!?!?! one compiles and one doesnt

device often times out the first time running gui

I tried to make a stop button, but you cant press another button until the last command has run, figure out a way around this. 

figure out how to better adjust layout, its weird right now
